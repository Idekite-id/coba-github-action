= Quality Skill Area
The software quality skill area consists of fundamental skills that a software engineer needs to possess in order to produce a highquality product, which is defined as one that conforms to its requirements and satisfies user needs. The software quality skill area includes both software quality assurance and software quality control, which includes verification and validation. 

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) includes all competencies associated with ensuring a quality process. In other words, SQA within an organization establishes a series of processes, methods, standards, and techniques that are used throughout the organization to develop high-quality products. 

Software Quality Control (SQC) includes all competencies associated with ensuring a quality product. In other words, an organization ensures that the software product will meet its quality goals through SQC. Software quality control may also be referred to as Software Validation and Verification; there are, however, some minor differences between the two terms. Software Verification and Validation consists of fundamental competencies that a software engineer should possess in order to produce a high-quality product.
