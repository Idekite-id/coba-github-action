= Construction Skill Area

Construction is the collection of activities and processes for converting design specifications into functional software solutions that meet customer needs. It includes planning, designing, programming, debugging, testing, and integrating software components. 

Most software construction is performed by teams of professionals using tools (editors, compilers, version control software, debuggers, and so forth) and processes to accomplish and coordinate their work.
