Project management involves managing the operations of an individual project within a program. Project management is focused on creating deliverables as efficiently as possible, program management is focused on maximizing the benefits realized by the organization.

Project management is a bit more tactical than program management, it mainly focuses on the operational elements of the project such as meeting deadlines, staying within budget, and completing deliverables. The project manager coordinates time, budget, resources and delegates tasks across the team.
