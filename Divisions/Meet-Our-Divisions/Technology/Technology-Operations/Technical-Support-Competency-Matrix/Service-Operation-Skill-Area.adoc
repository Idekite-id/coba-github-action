= Service Operation Skill Area

An organisation's strategic objectives are only realized by operating the service. This requires effective and efficient delivery and support of IT services to ensure the customer realises the value which was intended.

Service operations entails maintenance and making sure the services are running as per the planâ€”status quo is achieved. Service operations deals with maintaining services that have been implemented in the service transition phase. In this phase, no functional or nonfunctional modifications are performed to the service. A status quo is maintained, ensuring that the service runs as it was designed to.
