= Service Design Skill Area

IT services cannot provide value to the business unless they have been designed to meet business objectives. Service design is the lifecycle stage where the service strategy is turned into an achievable plan for delivering the business objectives.

The ITIL Service Design stage provides 2 things:

1. Guidance for designing and developing services and service management practices
2. Design principles and methods for converting strategic objectives into portfolios of services and related assets.

Service strategy provides the basic framework to create value, and the service design fits the pieces of the puzzle into its creation. The purpose of the service design phase is to develop designs for the IT services that were envisioned in the service strategy phase, along with the policy and process documents that are necessary to control and govern the designed IT services.

The designs must fit into the environment the customer is looking to deal with, ensuring maximum customer satisfaction and minimum costs while meeting all the quality requirements.
