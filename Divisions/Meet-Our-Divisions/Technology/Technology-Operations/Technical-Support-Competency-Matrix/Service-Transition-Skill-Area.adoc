= Service Transition Skill Area

After the service has been designed, it must be transitioned into operational use. This is done by a new or changed service design package being tested to ensure it meets the business needs. This is then deployed into the live production environment.

The ITIL Service Transition stage introduces the concept of a service knowledge management system (SKMS), which supports organisational learning and helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all the service lifecycle stages. It enables people to learn lessons, supports informed decision-making, and improves the management of services.
