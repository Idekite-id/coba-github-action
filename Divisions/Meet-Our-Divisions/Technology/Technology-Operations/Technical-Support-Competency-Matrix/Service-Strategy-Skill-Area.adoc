= Service Strategy Skill Area

Successful organisations tend to have clear objectives, and a clear overall business strategy explaining how the organisation intends to achieve those objectives. The overall business strategy tends to have individual strategies for the different business units within the organisation, one of which is an IT strategy. The IT strategy therefore supports and validates the business strategy.

An IT strategy covers multiple aspects, one of which is the IT service strategy. This explains how IT services will be used to enable IT to achieve its objectives, and how IT services support the overall business strategy.
